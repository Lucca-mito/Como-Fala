    This is the Como Fala webpage.
    Como Fala (Portuguese for "How do you say?") is an app to help speakers of 
    Brazilian Portuguese, such as myself, to learn how to pronounce words in 
    English.

    This is neither a language-learning app nor a translation app. Such apps 
    teach you what the English word is, but not how to pronounce it. This app 
    is a complement to these apps: it assumes you know what the English word 
    is, and shows you how to pronounce it.

    This is usually done using the text-to-speech feature of, say, Google 
    Translate. But seeing a textual description of how to pronounce a word in 
    addition to hearing it is more helpful than just hearing it. Traditionally, 
    this textual description is the role of the International Phonetic Alphabet 
    (IPA). However, very few (besides linguists) are familiar with it. Even 
    fewer have memorized the sometimes-unintuitive sounds made by every single 
    IPA character. 
    
    This app is just an IPA transliterator. It fetches an IPA syllabifiction of 
    the inputted word, then outputs a transliteration that, when read by a 
    speaker of Brazilian Portuguese, should resemble what the word sounds like 
    in American English. Since these two languages are very different, this 
    transliteration is an approximation. (I tried my best.) 

    This version does not include audio transcription; I'll implement that in a 
    later version.
